<p>
<H4>1. W3C investigations</H4>

The HTML language is the result of the work of the W3C. These research works go through several stages that have evolved over time. Currently, research results are published in three stages:
"Drafts", Working Drafts, are published to share research progress with others.
Specifications are published when the language is nearly finished and ready to use.
Recommendations are published once the language is officially approved and finalized. Sometimes it takes a long time to go from a specification to a recommendation, maybe even years.

<H4>2. The HyperText Markup Language</H4>

It was in 1991 when Tim Berners-Lee wrote the first "drafts" of HTML.
In June 1993, the first technical document appears describing the HTML language: "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) - A Representation of Textual Information and MetaInformation for Retrieval and Interchange". On November 8, 1993, HTML+ appears.
HTML version 2 sees the light on September 22, 1995 under the auspices of the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force).
In March 1995, HTML 3 is published, which is presented as an "extension" of HTML 2. It is quickly replaced by the recommendation of HTML 3.2, on March 14. January 1997. The HTML 4.01 recommendation is published on December 24, 1999. For the W3C, this version is the latest version of HTML. The W3C thinks that the future of web pages is not in HTML, but in XML. HTML is "dead" for the W3C.

<H4>3. Evolution with XHTML</H4>

The HTML language carries intrinsic limitations:

the elements that can be used are limited to those indicated in the recommendation,
the language is very permissive: it is possible to indicate the name of the elements in upper or lower case, some closing tags are optional...
elements are not really semantic: the element can contain any type of text.
The W3C published on February 10, 1998, the recommendation of a new language, XML (eXtensible Markup Language). The fifth edition dates back to November 26, 2008. This language allows you to overcome all the limitations of HTML. In this way it is possible to create all the elements that we want, in a totally semantic way (for example, a element to contain a postal code or a element to include a price) and the syntax is very strict. This is an ideal language, especially for exchanging structured data on the web. But XML is also involved in many other W3C standard languages ​​(MathML, SVG...) and in other web technologies.
Due to its permissive syntax, HTML is incompatible with XML. To resolve this incompatibility, the W3C reformulated HTML syntax to be compatible with XML: it is XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language). The first recommendation comes out on January 26, 2000.

XHTML has a stricter syntax, as we can see in these two examples:

If an element is opened, the closing tag must be included:

The W3C publishes the XHTML 1.1 recommendation on May 31, 2001. The latest edition dates back to November 2010. This version addressed "true XML", with no bad or non-standards-compliant elements. This means that documents for the web could no longer use the text/html MIME type.
XHTML 2 appears only as a Working Draft in August 2002. This was to be a "pure" version of the language, without any commitment to the past, to the point where it was incompatible with existing web content! It was a very radical initiative. The W3C proposed a language totally disconnected from reality, made for computer scientists and not for web designers. By opting for incompatibility with what exists, the W3C made a serious strategic mistake.
The XHTML 2 recommendation was never published. On December 17, 2010, the W3C officially disbands that working group.

<H4>4. The WHATWG dissidents</H4>

Faced with this failure of the evolution of HTML recognized by the W3C, a group of "dissidents", led by Ian Hickson (then working at Opera Software), formed in 2004 their own working group on HTML, the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group, WHATW. The first members of the WHATWG came from Mozilla, Opera, Apple, and later, Google. The first results of his research were applied to forms. Ian Hickson was the editor and made all the final decisions. The WHATWG was initially concerned with forms (Web Forms 2.0) and web applications (Web Apps 1.0). Those two areas of work are now found in HTML5.
El WHATWG continúa con esas investigaciones, independientemente del W3C. Al HTML5 se le llama HTML Living Standard para no confundirlo con el HTML5 del W3C.

<center><h1 id="Whatis">What is HTML</h1> </center>
<p>
<H4>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.</H4>
It is a standard markup language for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes. HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:

Web development. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files. 
Internet navigation. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks. 
Web documentation. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.
It’s also worth noting that HTML is not considered a programming language as it can’t create dynamic functionality. It is now considered an official web standard. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) maintains and develops HTML specifications, along with providing regular updates. 

This article will go over the basics of HTML, including how it works, its pros and cons, and how it relates to CSS and JavaScript. The average website includes several different HTML pages. For instance, a home page, an about page, and a contact page would all have separate HTML files.

HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension. A web browser reads the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users can view it.

All HTML pages have a series of HTML elements, consisting of a set of tags and attributes. HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page. A tag tells the web browser where an element begins and ends, whereas an attribute describes the characteristics of an element. 

The three main parts of an element are: 

Opening tag – used to state where an element starts to take effect. The tag is wrapped with opening and closing angle brackets.  
Content – this is the output that other users see. 
Closing tag – the same as the opening tag, but with a forward slash before the element name. </p>     

<center><h1 id="History">HTML History</h1> </center>
<p>The origin of HTML dates back to 1980, when the physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a worker at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) proposed a new "hypertext" system for sharing documents. "Hypertext" systems had been developed years before. In the field of computing, "hypertext" allowed users to access information related to the electronic documents they were viewing. In a certain way, the primitive "hypertext" systems could be assimilated to the links of the current web pages. After completing the development of his "hypertext" system, Tim Berners-Lee submitted it to a call for proposals to develop a "hypertext" system for the Internet.

After joining forces with systems engineer Robert Cailliau, they submitted the winning entry called WorldWideWeb (W3).

The first formal document describing HTML was published in 1991 under the name HTML Tags and can still be found online today as a computer relic.

The first official proposal to convert HTML into a standard was made in 1993 by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). Although significant progress was made (at this time the tags for images, tables and forms were defined) neither of the two standard proposals, called HTML and HTML+, managed to become an official standard.

In 1995, the IETF organization organizes an HTML working group and manages to publish, on September 22 of that same year, the HTML 2.0 standard. Despite its name, HTML 2.0 is the first official HTML standard.

Starting in 1996, HTML standards are published by another standards body called W3C (World Wide Web Consortium). 

<H4>HTML 2.0</H4> 
was released on January 14, 1997 and is the first HTML recommendation published by the W3C.

This revision incorporates the latest developments in web pages developed up to 1996, such as Java applets and text flowing around images.

<H4>HTML 3.2</H4>  was released on April 24, 1998 (being a corrected version of the original December 18, 1997 release) and is a big leap from previous versions. Among its most notable innovations are CSS style sheets, the possibility of including small programs or scripts in web pages, improved accessibility of designed pages, complex tables and improvements in forms.

The latest official HTML specification was published on December 24, 1999 and is called.
<H4>HTML 4.01</H4>  It is a review and update of the HTML 4.0 version, so it does not include significant new features.

Since the release of HTML 4.01, HTML standardization activity has stopped and the W3C has focused on the development of the XHTML standard.

For this reason, in 2004, the companies Apple, Mozilla and Opera expressed their concern about the lack of interest of the W3C in HTML and decided to organize themselves into a new association called WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group).

The current activity of the WHATWG is focused on the future HTML5 standard, the first official draft of which was published on January 22, 2008.

Due to the strength of the companies that make up the WHATWG group and the publication of the <H4>HTML 5.0</H4>  drafts, in March 2007 the W3C decided to resume the HTML standardization activity.

Parallel to its activity with HTML, W3C has continued to standardize XHTML, an advanced, XML-based version of HTML.

The first version of XHTML is called XHTML 1.0 and was released on January 26, 2000 (and later revised on August 1, 2002).

<H4>XHTML 1.0</H4>  is an adaptation of HTML 4.01 to the XML language, so it maintains almost all its tags and features, but adds some restrictions and elements typical of XML.

<H4>HTML 1.1</H4>  version has already been released in draft form and is intended to modularize XHTML.

The draft of XHTML 2.0 has also been published, which will mean a very important change with respect to previous versions of XHTML. 
<H4>THE MOST IMPORTANT</H4> 

The most popular markup language among the developers HTML was started at CERN in 1989 with the idea of creating a hypertext system for the internet by Sir Tim Berners-Lee.

HTML was first launched in 1991 with the first version of the language, HTML 1.0, which was released in the same year. The first version of HTML was called HTML 1.0 Strict and was released in 1993.

HTML was then released in 1994 with the second version of the language, HTML 2.0, which was released in 1995. The second version of HTML was called HTML 2.0 Transitional and was released in 1997. In the year 1980, a physicist named Tim Berners-Lee come up with an idea of a system in which documents could be stored and shared with the researchers at CERN.

The idea was to create a system where researchers could create documents and share them with other researchers. The documents would be stored on a server and the researchers could access them through a web browser.

Then in 1989, he composed an update proposing an Internet-based Hypertext System for global computers. Tim Berners-Lee's idea was a model in which users can navigate from one set of information on a computer to another set of information on another computer. Tim Berners-Lee wrote the browser and server software for HTML in 1990.

Berners-Lee and another data system engineer collaborated in 1990 to request funding but CERN rejected the project.

In late 1991 Tim Berner-Lee publicly posted the description of HTML in a document called HTML Tags. The first version of HTML had 18 elements which were mostly influenced by SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) except for the hyperlink. 11 of those 18 elements exist in HTML4.

The basic characteristics for each element were defined in the browsers and these characteristics can be modified and enhanced using CSS.</p>

New semantic tags to structure HTML documents, intended to replace the need to have a tag that identifies each block on the page.

Improvements
There are new labels, the possibility of inserting audio and video directly on the web without the need for plugins or add-ons in browsers, and other new features. The W3C will progressively release new evolutions of HTML 5. </p> 

<center><h1 id="Feactures">Feactures</h1></center> 
<p>HTML has so many features that it took multiple RFCs (Request for Comments) to describe every part. It would be almost impossible to go through all the features in this article. However, we will go through the most popular ones that come in handy in a developer’s life.

<H4>1. User Friendly & Simple</H4>
You can write HTML using annotations called tags. Tags give HTML a structure and make it easy for humans and browsers to read the document efficiently. They also enable a browser to apply CSS (Cascaded StyleSheets) to the digital document, making it a powerful visual combination. 

While HTML comes with 100s of tags inbuilt, only a handful of them that a developer needs to learn for everyday use. Of course, all tags hold value; most of them don’t find usage in normal development.

<H4>2. Semantic Structure</H4>
HTML5 defines unique tags to annotate different elements for their specific purposes. The tag, for example, is used to annotate content on a page. The tag represents some content that is indirectly related to the document’s primary content. Other noteworthy elements are the paragraph tag, and the one most used for navigation between pages.

<H4>3. SEO – Search Engine Optimisation</H4>
SEO is by far the biggest USP (Unique Selling Point) of HTML5. With the advent of search engines like Google, Yahoo!, DuckDuckGo etc., you have so much information literally at your fingertips. These search engines accumulate information on the World Wide Web using computer programs that crawl the internet (also called web crawlers) and map keywords with respective documents in which they find it. These web crawlers can assimilate this data only because HTML is well structured, and you can optimise your web pages for searchability. 

To highlight SEO, let me bring to your attention that this page is also SEO optimised and should appear for the search query “Top features of HTML”. You can even make use of the semantic structure of HTML for Search Engines using tags like, to let the web crawler know about the critical keywords in the document.

<H4>4. localStorage & IndexedDB – Client-side data storage</H4>
HTML5 comes with essential improvements in storage capabilities on the client’s side. The localStorage and sessionStorage are crucial features that help developers store information on the client’s side. These are essential advancements in browser storage capabilities because cookies limit data storage size on the client side. One can store small pieces of information like authentication tokens or usernames on the client using cookies. Still, localStorage API is where storage comes in handy for users when they revisit the web application. Imagine not having to repeatedly load some standard information on the client, which saves a lot of resources for both client and server. The sessionStorage API enables a developer to persist information just for that session. Meaning, the data is wiped out as soon as the user closes that tab. This feature comes in handy for browser-based games or high-security applications that have a limited session.

IndexedDB takes client-side storage a step beyond what localStorage does. While you could potentially store a lot of data with localStorage in a key-value form where both are strings, you can store more complex and significant data in the key-value form using IndexedDB. The key is a string, and the value to be stored is a native JavaScript object. Oh, and this object will persist through the IndexedDB until someone explicitly removes it. 

IndexedDB enables the web application to store data on the client-side, i.e. the browser, and allows your web application to continue functioning even with flaky or a dropped internet connection. Let us talk more about this in the next feature.

<H4>5. Offline Capabilities (PWA) with Cache API & Service Workers</H4>
Imagine if you could build a web application that works even when the user’s internet is down. Well, you don’t have to imagine because, with the advent of Service Workers, IndexedDB and Cache API, you could very well make this a reality. Your web application could offer a native-like experience to your users. Many applications like Flipkart already do this, and it’s called a PWA (Progressive Web Application).

Service Workers act as a proxy between the user’s machine and the internet. They can store files locally and fetch them when needed via the Cache API and can also bring information from the IndexedDB to provide the application with data. So, when there’s no internet on a user’s device, the Service Worker intercepts these requests and serves them from the locally stored data. You can configure your service worker to update these files periodically or on-demand. 

<H4>6. Canvas for Game Development</H4>
You can use HTML5 to build some simple games; however, if you’re looking to make a good video game, you can utilise the element along with CSS and JavaScript. Canvas enables you to build 2D and 3D games. You can make these games as interactive as you’d like.

<H4>7. Platform Independent</H4>
HTML runs on a browser, and you can find a browser on almost any device with a simple Operating System. If you had used mobile phones before smartphones were a thing, you would know that even old Nokia phones that ran Symbian OS could open HTML pages.

<H4>8. Media Support</H4>
HTML can display images, video and audio; therefore, it enjoys excellent media-running capabilities. HTML5 came up with and tags making this a lot easier than before. Of course, with HTML5, you can go beyond just playing media; you can specify controls, images for buttons and even control the playback programmatically.

The tag also deserves a special mention because it has revolutionised rendering images on a browser. You can also represent captions using the tag along with the tag.</p> 

<center><h1 id="Ad&dis">Advantaged & Disadvantages</h1></center> 
<p>
<H4>Advantages of HTML:</H4>
<H5>1. First advantage it is widely used.</H5>
<H5>2. Every browser supports HTML language.</H5>
<H5>3. Easy to learn and use.</H5>
<H5>4. It is by default in every windows so you don't need to purchase extra software.</H5>
<H4>Disadvantages of HTML:</H4>
<H5>1. It can create only static and plain pages so if we need dynamic pages then HTML
is not useful.</H5>
<H5>2. Need to write lot of code for making simple webpage.</H5>
<H5>3. Security features are not good in HTML.</H5>
<H5>4. If we need to write long code for making a webpage then it produces some complexity.</H5>
